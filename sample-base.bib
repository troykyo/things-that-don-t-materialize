abstract = {The TTSM project, funded by Loughborough and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council UK (EPSRC), investigates ways in which 'textile thinking' might inform the development of new sustainable materials for design-led functions, alternative use of materials technologies in design, and novel application of existing sustainable materials within design contexts. The project focuses on exploring textiles, encompassing textile materials, processes and modes of conceptualisation, as a site for interdisciplinary innovation in relation to sustainable design. To date, the project has brought together textile designers and materials scientists with input from product designers, chemists and engineers to establish a number of creative dialogues via an interactive networking event that was held at Loughborough University in May 2012. The aims are to explore the development of new sustainable materials for design-led functions; alternative use of materials technologies towards design and new applications of existing sustainable materials within design contexts; to capture and present emerging dialogues and concepts to create platforms for new research pathways; and to assess the application of 'textile thinking' within sustainable materials design as a means of advancing knowledge within this field. The project draws on the pervasive nature of textiles to consider the possibilities of materials from process perspectives, drawing on traditional textile production methods including weaving, knitting, printing and embroidery; aesthetic perspectives, drawing on decorative traditions; and functional perspectives, drawing on perceptions of use. It was hoped that a multi-perspectival approach would surpass that which could be achieved through artistic or scientific approaches used in isolation and that capturing and presenting emerging dialogues and concepts would create platforms for new research pathways, ultimately fostering further cross-disciplinary collaborative research projects. Through the paper we hope to explore material-related knowledge, specifically 'textile knowledge' within the context of current and projected challenges relating to sustainable materials design and, linking to the conference themes, how knowledge developed through textile designing and making might prepare future citizens to realise a more resilient future by informing sustainable design. 2. Sustainable design and materials Current and emerging sustainability agendas-relating to responsible sourcing of raw materials, encouraging sustainable behaviours in regard to use, and end of life considerations of material goods-provide the driver for the TTSM project. During the TTSM networking event in May 2012 Debra Lilley gave the following succinct and pertinent definition of sustainable design: Sustainable design addresses key environmental impacts of a product across its lifecycle, alongside cost, quality and appearance requirements, but then goes further and considers social elements. It aims to generate as much utility and enjoyment as possible out of the smallest possible quantity of resource over the longest possible (or most appropriate) period of time. Lilley noted that designers have direct influence over approximately 70 per cent of a product, reflecting the fact that the most critical decisions about its materials, aesthetic, function, performance, cost, durability and end-of-life options are determined in the early stages of design. Careful consideration must be made by the designer to ensure that negative effects are avoided and positive features included. Sustainable design is complex, involving multi-faceted challenges, perspectives and approaches. The TTSM project focuses on 'materials' as a starting point, drawing on the overt materiality of textiles.},

abstract = {Manufacturing systems can be modeled as networked work systems connected by material flow. Characteristics such as performance and robustness are influenced by the manufacturing network's static structure, i.e. the topology, and its dynamic behavior, i.e. the material flow. The statistical analysis of the topological features of networks has been used in many disciplines to predict dynamic behavior, however, the meaningfulness of each individual topological measure can differ between network types. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which topological measures can be used to evaluate and compare manufacturing networks. This article investigates procedures to identify significant over- or underrepresentation of three-node subgraphs, known as motifs, and the dynamical importance of single nodes in terms of their effect on the largest eigenvalue. The results show that both approaches are suited to indicate dynamical behavior of a manufacturing systems solely based topological information. These techniques can be used for a quick assessment of existing or planned manufacturing systems without extensive and complex modeling.},

We describe the design and construction of an augmented acoustic guitar called Carolan alongside activities to build its digital footprint through documented encounters with twenty-seven players in a variety of settings. We reveal the design challenge of mapping the different surfaces of the instrument to various facets of its footprint so as to afford appropriate experiences to players, audiences and technicians.

abstract = {We explore the crafting of interactive decoration for everyday artefacts. This involves adorning them with decorative patterns that enhance their beauty while triggering digital interactions when scanned with cam-eras. These are realized using an existing augmented reality technique that embeds computer readable codes into the topological structures of hand-drawn patterns. We describe a research through design process that engaged artisans to craft a portfolio of interactive artefacts, including ceramic bowls, embroidered gift cards, fabric souvenirs, and an acoustic guitar. We annotate this portfolio with reflections on the crafting process, revealing how artisans addressed pattern, materials, form and function, and digital mappings throughout their craft process. Further reflection on our portfolio reveals how they bridged between human and sys-tem perceptions of visual patterns and engaged in a deep embedding of digital interactions into physical materials. Our findings demonstrate the potential for interactive decoration, distilling the craft knowledge involved in creating aesthetic and functional decoration, highlight the need for transparent computer vision technologies, and raise wider issues for HCI's growing engagement with craft.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a data-driven process for designing and fab- ricating materials with desired deformation behavior. Our process starts with measuring deformation properties of base materials. For each base material we acquire a set of example deformations, and we represent the material as a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We have validated our material measure- ment process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization pro- cess that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space. We demonstrate the complete process by designing and fabricating objects with complex heterogeneous materials using modern multi-material 3D printers},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) are biologically inspired computing techniques, which tend to mimic the basic Darwinian concepts of natural selection. They are highly robust and efficient for most engineering optimising studies. Although a late entrant in the materials arena, GAs based studies are increasingly making their presence felt in many different aspects of this discipline. In recent times, GAs have been successfully used in numerous problems in the areas of atomistic material design, alloy design, polymer processing, powder compaction and sintering, ferrous production metallurgy, continuous casting, metal rolling, metal cutting, welding, and so on. The present review attempts to present the state of the art in this area. It includes three broad sections given as: fundamentals of genetic algorithms, genetic algorithms in materials design, and genetic algorithms in materials processing. The first section provides the reader with the basic concepts and the intricacies associated with this novel technique. The following section presents a detailed account of the usage of GAs to design various materials, predominantly at the atomic level. The third section aims to capture the process of applicability of GAs in numerous materials processing operations. A thorough literature search and critical analysis of the research conducted so far is provided, and attempts have been made to demonstrate how one single methodology can be utilised to study virtually every area of the vast materials discipline.},

We developed a novel textile display technology, called Ebb, and created several woven and crochet fabric swatches that explored clothing-specific design possibilities. We engaged fashion designers and non-designers in imagining how Ebb would integrate into their design practice or personal style of dressing. Participants evaluated the appeal and utility of clothing-based displays according to a very different set of criteria than traditional screen-based computational displays. Specifically, the slowness, low-resolution, and volatility of Ebb tended to be seen as assets as opposed to technical limitations in the context of personal style. Additionally, participants envisioned various ways that ambiguous, ambient, and abstract displays of information could prompt new experiences in their everyday lives. Our paper details the complex relationships between display and personal style and offers a new design metaphor and extension of Gaver et al.s original descriptions of ambiguity in order to guide the design of clothing-based displays for everyday life.},

@book{Dourish2017,
abstract = {"The central topic of 'The Stuff of Bits' is the materialities of information. This term often brings to mind the materiality of information infrastructures - server farms, air conditioning, fiber optic cable routes, and distributed storage. By contrast, 'The Stuff of Bits' focuses on digital information itself as something with which we - as designers, as users, as citizens, as customers, and as human beings - have a material engagement. The book is anchored by four case studies - one on computer emulation, one on spreadsheets, one on databases, and one on network architectures - organized in terms of the scopes of engagement. Through these cases, a common analytic strategy is to identify not just their materiality but their materialities, that is, not just the brute fact of their material forms but the specific material properties that they display and the consequences of those properties - properties like granularity, transparency, directness, weight, and malleability. The idea is that, in the realm of the digital, everything may be reduced to 'bits' but those bits are not all of equal significance; particular encodings reflect particular needs and expectations of change, adaptation, and evolution. To a certain extent this is similar to 'constraints' and 'affordances' in Don Norman's Six Principles of Design and the driving force behind the Platform Studies series, in that different mediums, or materialities, promote distinct use and reception. As Paul Dourish writes in the Introduction to this book, 'material arrangements of information--how it is represented and how that shapes how it can be put to work--matters significantly for our experience of information and information systems'"--Provided by publisher.

The program has a backend which generates different components of the sole, such as the treads, the sur-face, the insole pattern and the contour (where the sole will be connected to the rest of the shoe). Instead of the traditio-nal fixed grids, we use Voronoi diagrams, which have another aesthetic appeal and which allow influ-encing the dynamic behavior of the sole. This program shows an example of the possibilities of digital fabrica-tion (3D printing) for the personalization of material properties and behavior when combined with mathematical algorithms. Moreover, we highlight our approach and interesting algorithmic aspects like intersecting edges and contours, generating Voronoi diagrams, finding polygons, solving the Chinese postman problem, and solving the travelling salesman problem. 1 Background and vision We envision future product service systems where the user has more influence on the products he or she pur-chases and plays a role in the programming of the material. The primary technological enablers for this change are twofold: first the advent and widespread application of digital manufacturing equipment which may gradual-ly replace the traditional manufacturing equipment. In traditional manufacturing, there is one expensive mold or one machine setup, or one human drill, which is prepared once and then executed many times. The efficiency of this type of manufacturing demands that there are large numbers of the same products which are produced in large batches. With digital manufactur-ing, one machine can produce a huge variety of designs without mold making, training or machine reconfigura-tion. Examples are digital printers, digital embroidery machines, CNC milling machines, and of course 3D print-ers. At present, traditional manufacturing can still provide better quality at lower cost, but as additive manufac-turing improves quickly, the vision of the users personalizing products gains feasibility. The second technologi-cal enabler is the Internet, which allows any user to create, share and manage digital information. There are other enablers as well, such as changes in logistics chains. Web shops with online payments and fast delivery services are getting very common.},

abstract = {Background: Injury in initial military training is common with incidences from 25 to 65{\%} of recruits sustaining musculoskeletal injury. Risk factors for injury include extrinsic factors such as rapid onset of high volume training, but intrinsic factors such as lower limb biomechanics and foot type. Prediction of injury would allow more effective training delivery, reduce manpower wastage and improve duty of care to individuals by addressing potential interventions. Plantar pressure interpretation of footfall has been shown to reflect biomechanical intrinsic abnormality although no quantifiable method of risk stratification exists. Objective: To identify if pressure plate assessment of walking gait is predictive of injury in a military population. Method: 200 male subjects commencing Naval Officer training were assessed by plantar pressure plate recording, of foot contact pressures. A software interpretation, D3D™, stratified the interpretation to measure 4 specific areas of potential correction. Participants were graded as to high, medium and low risk of injury and subsequently followed up for injury through their basic training. Results: Seventy two percent of all injuries were attributed to subjects in the high and medium risk of injury as defined by the risk categorization. 47{\%} of all injuries were sustained in the high-risk group. Participants categorized in the high-risk group for injury were significantly more likely to sustain injury than in medium or low groups (p{\textless}. 0.001, OR 5.28 with 95{\%} CI 2.88, 9.70). Conclusions: Plantar pressure assessment of risk for overuse lower limb injury can be predictive of sustaining an overuse injury in a controlled training environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this essay, I explore several facets of research through design in order to contribute to discussions about how the approach should develop. The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.},

abstract = {The coming ubiquity of computational things urges us to consider what it means for something to be present in someone's life, in contrast to being just used for something. "Use" and "presence" represent two perspectives on what a thing is. While "use" refers to a general description of a thing in terms of what it is used for, "presence" refers to existential definitions of a thing based on how we invite and accept it as a part of our lifeworld. Searching for a basis on which these existential definitions are formed, we argue that the expressions of things are central for accepting them as present in our lives. We introduce the notion of an expressional, referring to a thing designed to be the bearer of certain expressions, just as an appliance is designed to be the bearer of a certain functionality. Aesthetics, as a logic of expressions, can provide a proper foundation for design for presence. We discuss the expressiveness of computational things as depending both on time structures and space structures. An aesthetical leitmotif for the design of computational things--a leitmotif that may be used to guide a normative design philosophy, or a design style--is described. Finally, we describe a practical example of what designing a mobile phone as an "expressional" might be like.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). We present metamaterial textures-3D printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. Metamaterial textures are integrated into 3D printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. Inspired by foldable paper sheets ("origami") and surface wrinkling, our 3D printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. Unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. This allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. Metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. This allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. We present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation.},

We conducted an 'in the wild study' by deploying our system in six households where participants were experiencing five different material representations of their physical activity for a period of two weeks each. We found that the material artifacts made participants more conscious about their involvement in physical activity and illustrated different levels of engagement with the artifacts. Along with reporting the gained insights from the deployments, we offer reflections on designing material representations for physical activity. We hope that our work will inspire designers to consider new possibilities afforded by digital fabrication to support user's experience with physical activity by utilizing interactive technologies at our disposal.},

Customers will be able to adapt the open platform to their needs by integrating modules of their choice into the platform, thereby constructing individual products that fit their exact needs. Large manufacturers will produce the platforms, and small companies will invent and produce modules that could be interfaced with the open-platform products. Smartphones is an example of an open-platform product, and the Apps that are designed to run on smartphones are examples for modules. Each customer downloads certain Apps that fit his/her needs, thereby creating an individual smartphone. The Apps, however, are software modules. The modules that are considered in this paper are hardware modules. Open-platform products will create a new paradigm in product design and utilization that we call the Mass-Individualization paradigm. The Mass-Individualization paradigm will boost the economy by (1) creating many new jobs in module production companies and (2) increasing the level of sales of consumer products.},

Although there are several different principles of pattern construction, the far majority are derived from the same approximation of the body based on horizontal and vertical measurements. Based on Lindqvist's[1] model for enhance pattern technology, building on a number of key biomechanical point and balance lines instead of horizontal and vertical measurements of the body, this paper demonstrates the potential of the proposed technology in two garments for a specific function. The relevance of this new garment construction technology is significance because it presents a previously unknown model to construct garments with significantly increased ergonomics and agility as well as presenting a new theory of approximation of the body from which further construction principles could be developed.},

(A) An early sketch of a stool design relying on Digital Joinery; (B) using the Generative Joinery Design Tool, the software generates digital joints; (C) a rendering of a complete stool with digital joints; (D) a 3D-printed (by selective laser sintering) Nylon-12 joint with its anchors; (D) a closeup photograph of a dyed and assembled Voronoi diagram skeleton joint, connecting four wooden beams; (E) a photograph of the finished stool (by Daniel Shechter). ABSTRACT The craft of carpentry relies on joinery: the connections between pieces of wood to create multipart structures. In traditional woodworking, joints are limited to the manual chisel skills of the craftsperson, or to capabilities of the machines, which favorite 90° or 180° angle joints with no more than two elements. We contribute an interactive design process in which joints are generated digitally to allow for unrestricted beam connectors, then produced from Nylon-12 using selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printing. We present our Generative Joinery Design Tool and demonstrate our system on a selection of stools. The paper exemplifies the potential of Digital Joinery to enhance carpentry by incorporating a hybrid and interactive level of design sophistication and affordances that are very hard to achieve with traditional skills and tools.},

@article{Moreno2016,
abstract = {Design has been recognised in the literature as a catalyst to move away from the traditional model of take-make-dispose to achieve a more restorative, regenerative and circular economy. As such, for a circular economy to thrive, products need to be designed for closed loops, as well as be adapted to generate revenues. This should not only be at the point of purchase, but also during use, and be supported by low-cost return chains and reprocessing structures, as well as effective policy and regulation. To date, most academic and grey literature on the circular economy has focused primarily on the development of new business models, with some of the latter studies addressing design strategies for a circular economy, specifically in the area of resource cycles and design for product life extension. However, these studies primarily consider a limited spectrum of the technical and biological cycles where materials are recovered and restored and nutrients (e.g., materials, energy, water) are regenerated. This provides little guidance or clarity for designers wishing to design for new circular business models in practice. As such, this paper aims to address this gap by systematically analysing previous literature on Design for Sustainability (DfX) (e.g., design for resource conservation, design for slowing resource loops and whole systems design) and links these approaches to the current literature on circular business models. A conceptual framework is developed for circular economy design strategies. From this conceptual framework, recommendations are made to enable designers to fully consider the holistic implications for design within a circular economy.},

The idea of slow technology is applied during the inquiry and new methods of non-electronic sensing are developed. The first approach uses flexible, conductive 3D printed material to construct pressure sensors in the shoe sole. The second approach uses photographic analysis and material color change to determine use over time. The third method creates micro geometric structures via code that are intended to break in specific ways with specific use. Although many hours are spent developing these approaches, the shoe serves as a research archetype that attempts to asks questions about precision, design and sustainability.},

To gain an insight into these problems, designers envision a space of various alternative solutions and explore various performance trade-offs, often manually. To assist designers with rapidly generating and exploring a design space, researchers introduced the concept of design synthesis methods. These methods promote innovative thinking and provide solutions that can augment a designer's abilities to solve problems. Recent advances in technology push the boundaries of design synthesis methods in various ways: a vast number of novel solutions can be generated using high-performance computing in a timely manner, complex geometries can be fabricated using additive manufacturing, and integrated sensors can provide feedback for the next design generation using the Internet of things (IoT). Therefore, new synthesis methods should be able to provide designs that improve over time based on the feedback they receive from the use of the products. To this end, the objective of this study is to demonstrate a design synthesis approach that, based on high-level design requirements gathered from sensor data, generates numerous alternative solutions targeted for additive manufacturing. To demonstrate this method, we present a case study of design iteration on a car chassis},

abstract = {States of self-stress-tensions and compressions of structural elements that result in zero net forces-play an important role in determining the load-bearing ability of structures ranging from bridges to metamaterials with tunable mechanical properties. We exploit a class of recently introduced states of self-stress analogous to topo-logical quantum states to sculpt localized buckling regions in the interior of periodic cellular metamaterials. Although the topological states of self-stress arise in the linear response of an idealized mechanical frame of harmonic springs connected by freely hinged joints, they leave a distinct signature in the nonlinear buckling behavior of a cellular material built out of elastic beams with rigid joints. The salient feature of these localized buckling regions is that they are indistinguishable from their surroundings as far as material parameters or connectivity of their constituent elements are concerned. Furthermore, they are robust against a wide range of structural perturbations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this topological design through analytical and numerical calculations as well as buckling experiments performed on two-and three-dimensional metamaterials built out of stacked kagome lattices. isostatic lattices | topological modes | topological mechanics | tunable failure M echanical metamaterials are artificial structures with unusual properties that originate in the geometry of their constituents, rather than the specific material they are made of. Such structures can be designed to achieve a specific linear elastic response, like auxetic (negative Poisson ratio) (1) or pentamode (zero-shear modulus) (2) elasticity. However, it is often their nonlinear behavior that is exploited to engineer highly responsive materials, the properties of which change drastically under applied stress or confinement (3-7). Coordinated buckling of the building blocks of a metamaterial is a classic example of nonlinear behavior that can be used to drive the auxetic response (4, 8), modify the phononic properties (5), or generate 3D micro/nanomaterials from 2D templates (9). Buckling-like shape transitions in porous and cellular meta-materials involve large deformations from the initial shape, typically studied through finite element simulations. However, many aspects of the buckling behavior can be successfully captured in an approximate description of the structure that is easier to analyze (5, 6, 10, 11). Here, we connect the mechanics of a cellular metamaterial, a foamlike structure made out of slender flexible elements (12, 13), to that of a frame-a simpler, idealized assembly of rigid beams connected by free hinges-with the same beam geometry. We exploit the linear response of a recently introduced class of periodic frames (14), inspired by topologically protected quantum materials, to induce a robust nonlinear buckling response in selected regions of two-and three-dimensional cellular metamaterials. Frames, also known as trusses, are ubiquitous minimal models of mechanical structures in civil engineering and materials science. Their static response to an external load is obtained by balancing the forces exerted on the freely hinged nodes against internal stresses (tensions or compressions) of the beams. However, a unique set of equilibrium stresses may not always be found for any load (15). First, the structure may have loads that cannot be carried because they excite hinge motions called zero modes that leave all beams unstressed. Second, the structure may support states of self-stress-combinations of tensions and compressions on the beams that result in zero net forces on each hinge. An arbitrary linear combination of states of self-stress can be added to an internal stress configuration without disrupting static equilibrium, implying that degenerate stress solutions exist for any load that can be carried. The respective counts N m and N ss of zero modes and states of self-stress in a d-dimensional frame with n n nodes and n b beams are related to each other by the generalized Maxwell relation (16, 17): dn n − n b = N m − N ss. [1] As Eq. 1 shows, states of self-stress count the excess constraints imposed by the beams on the dn n degrees of freedom provided by the hinge positions. States of self-stress play a special role in the mechanical response of repetitive frames analyzed under periodic boundary conditions (18). Macroscopic stresses in such systems correspond to boundary loads, which can only be balanced by states of self-stress involving beams that cross the boundaries. If these states span the entire system, boundary loads are borne by tensions and compressions of beams throughout the structure. Conversely, by localizing states of self-stress to a small portion of a frame, load-bearing ability is conferred only to that region. Our approach consists of piling up states of self-stress in a specific region of a repetitive frame so that the beams participating in these states of self-stress are singled out to be compressed under a uniform load at the boundary. In a cellular material with the same beam geometry , these beams buckle when the compression exceeds their buckling threshold. Significance An ongoing challenge in modern materials science is to create artificial structures, termed metamaterials, with an unconven-tional response that can be programmed by suitable design of their geometry or topology. We demonstrate a novel meta-material in which small structural variations single out regions that buckle selectively under external stresses. Surprisingly, these regions are at first glance indistinguishable from the rest of the structure. Our samples are examples of topological meta-materials that are the mechanical analogues of topologically protected electronic systems. As a result, the buckling response is robust against structural perturbations yet tunable without affecting secondary physical properties in the buckling region. This feature is desirable for optomechanical or thermomechanical metamaterials in which multiple characteristics need to be tuned simultaneously.},

abstract = {Semiconductor diodes are basic building blocks of modern computation, communications and sensing 1. As such, incorporating them into textile-grade fibres can increase fabric capabilities and functions 2 , to encompass, for example, fabric-based communications or physiological monitoring. However, processing challenges have so far precluded the realization of semiconducting diodes of high quality in thermally drawn fibres. Here we demonstrate a scalable thermal drawing process of electrically connected diode fibres. We begin by constructing a macroscopic preform that hosts discrete diodes internal to the structure alongside hollow channels through which conducting copper or tungsten wires are fed. As the preform is heated and drawn into a fibre, the conducting wires approach the diodes until they make electrical contact, resulting in hundreds of diodes connected in parallel inside a single fibre. Two types of in-fibre device are realized: light-emitting and photodetecting p-in diodes. An inter-device spacing smaller than 20 centimetres is achieved, as well as light collimation and focusing by a lens designed in the fibre cladding. Diode fibres maintain performance throughout ten machine-wash cycles, indicating the relevance of this approach to apparel applications. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, a three-megahertz bi-directional optical communication link is established between two fabrics containing receiver-emitter fibres. Finally, heart-rate measurements with the diodes indicate their potential for implementation in all-fabric physiological-status monitoring systems. Our approach provides a path to realizing ever more sophisticated functions in fibres, presenting the prospect of a fibre 'Moore's law' analogue through the increase of device density and function in thermally drawn textile-ready fibres.},

abstract = {Shape decomposition is a fundamental problem for part-based shape representation. We propose the minimum near-convex decomposition (MNCD) to decompose arbitrary shapes into minimum number of "near-convex" parts. The near-convex shape decomposition is formulated as a discrete optimization problem by minimizing the number of nonintersecting cuts. Two perception rules are imposed as constraints into our objective function to improve the visual naturalness of the decomposition. With the degree of near-convexity a user-specified parameter, our decomposition is robust to local distortions and shape deformation. The optimization can be efficiently solved via binary integer linear programming. Both theoretical analysis and experiment results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art results without introducing redundant parts and thus leads to robust shape representation.},

Although ERLLI are thought to be multi-factorial in aetiology, one of the critical predisposing factors is known to gait abnormality. There is little published evidence comparing walking and running gait in the same subjects, and no evidence on the effect of gait velocity on calcaneal pronation, even though this may have implications for orthotic prescription and injury prevention. In this study, the walking and running gait of 50 physically active subjects was assessed using pressure plate analysis. The results show that rearfoot pronation occurs on foot contact in both running and walking gait, and that there is significantly more rearfoot pronation in walking gait (p{\textless}0.01). The difference in the magnitude of rearfoot pronation affected foot orthoses prescription. A 63{\%} fall in computerized correction suggested by RSscan D3D™ software prescription was seen, based on running vs. walking gait. The findings of this study suggest that in the athletic population orthoses prescription should be based on dynamic assessment of running gait.},

abstract = {The computer is no longer the center of attention. Thus, what we design is no longer the interface to the computer. Rather, what we design is a thing or an environment in which a computer might be used to create certain desired effects. Indeed, interaction design in a sense becomes the practice of giving form to artifacts or environments rather like any of the other design disciplines that we have know for centuries. However, giving form to computational things is highly complex and somewhat different than most other form-giving practices due to its temporal form element-its ability to change between states. Thus, an interaction design practice needs to encompass this temporal form giving in combination with physical form giving and performances of the interaction gestalt. In this paper, I propose this trinity of forms as a framework to unfold the practice of interaction design. I further demonstrate how computational composites present a way to work with the temporal form and the physical form in a process not too different from any traditional form-giving practice. Lastly, I point to some tools and techniques to deal with the interdependencies of the three form elements and thereby also demonstrate that a form-giving practice of interaction design is already well under way.},

Our framework – developed over two conference workshops – provides a frame for discussion of embodied design actions that leverage the power of estrangement.

Such an understanding can help in comparison, analysis, selection of suitable technology, and also in the generation of new ideas. In this article, we survey the state of the art in 3D printing fully functional sensors and actuators to support explicit interaction techniques. We classify and organize the surveyed works around the following parameters: mechanism, designed affordances, interaction primitives, and output modality. The design space is presented in the form of a multidimensional matrix known as a Zwicky box. Using the tables, we can make observations about the existing literature and also identify gaps in this design space. Many such gaps can potentially lead to exciting new research or engineering opportunities.},
